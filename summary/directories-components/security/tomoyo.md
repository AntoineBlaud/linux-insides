# Tomoyo

Tomoyo Linux is a MAC implementation for [Linux](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Linux) that can be used to increase the security of a system, while also being useful purely as a [systems analysis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Systems\_analysis) tool. It was launched in March 2003 and was sponsored by [NTT Data Corporation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/NTT\_Data\_Corporation) until March 2012.[\[1\]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tomoyo\_Linux#citenote1)

Tomoyo Linux focuses on system behaviour. Tomoyo Linux allows each process to declare behaviours and resources needed to achieve their purpose. When protection is enabled, Tomoyo Linux restricts each process to the behaviours and resources allowed by the administrator.
