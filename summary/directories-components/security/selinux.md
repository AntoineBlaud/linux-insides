# SELinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a [security](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security) architecture for [LinuxÂ® systems](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux) that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the [Linux kernel](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel) using Linux Security Modules (LSM). &#x20;
